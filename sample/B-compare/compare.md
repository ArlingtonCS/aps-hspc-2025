# B: Compare

We're going to make things a little harder for the second sample problem. This
problem has an input, but luckily, our sample code does all the parsing for
you! Your code just has to return the correct response. However, for some
problems you may have to print the response yourself.

## Input

Your input will be 2 numbers each on their own line. The numbers will be in the
range from -100 to 100.

## Output

Print out the larger of the two numbers on its own line.


## Sample Input

```
1
2
```

## Sample Output

```
2

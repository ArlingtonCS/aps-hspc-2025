# E: Hidden Signals

You are an elite codebreaker for the HSPC (Highly Secretive Protocol Command), a secret organization dedicated to intercepting and decrypting enemy transmissions. Your latest assignment involves a coded message sent by a notorious double agent. The agent's messages are usually layered with complex instructions designed to mislead anyone trying to decipher them.

Your task is to decode the message by following a series of commands issued by HSPC's decryption protocol. Each command alters the encoded string through character replacements, deletions, or insertions. As an agent of HSPC, itâ€™s your job to carefully execute each command in order to reveal the hidden message.

## Input

The input begins with an integer ```T```, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

The first line contains an integer ```N```, the number of commands.
The second line contains the original encoded message, a string of lowercase letters.
Each of the next ```N``` lines contains one command in one of three possible formats:

 - replace ```old_char``` with ```new_char``` - replaces each occurrence of ```old_char``` in the message with ```new_char```.
 - delete ```char``` - removes each occurrence of ```char``` from the message.
 - insert ```char``` before ```position``` - inserts ```char``` before the character at the specified (1-based) ```position``` in the message.

The encoded message will have a length between 1 and 100 characters. There will be at most 30 commands. The position for insertion will always be valid (within the bounds of the current message).

## Output

Output the decrypted string message after applying all the commands in the specified order.

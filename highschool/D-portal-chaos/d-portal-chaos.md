# D: Portal Chaos

While on a top secret mission, one of our junior operatives, Johnny, tripped
and dropped our portal generator. When the generator hit the floor, it started
generating extra portals, and our operative was forced to return. Luckily, 
the generator broadcasted the details of all the portals it generated. As our top
operative at Hyper-Space Portal Corporation (HSPC), your mission, should you chose
to accept it, is to navigate the maze of portals and safely retreieve our
portal generator. Each of the portals connects 2 rooms. You will always start in
room #1, and the portal will be in room #100. 

## Input

The first line is the number of portals that were generated, $n$. This is
followed by $n$ pairs of room numbers, which are each on a new line. Each pair
represents a portal which connects two rooms.

## Output 

Output the least number of portals you would have to travel through to get to
the generator.
